Development setup
------------------------
For development, the latest version of Android Studio 3.4 is required. The latest version can be
downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

### API keys

You need to supply API / client keys for the various services the
app uses. That is currently [News Api](https://newsapi.org/) and [Fabric](https://fabric.io) (for Crashlytics). You can find information about
how to gain access via the relevant links.

When you obtain the keys, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the
`gradle.properties` file in your user home:

```
# Get this from News Api
news_cards_news_api_key=<insert>

```

On Linux/Mac that file is typically found at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or in the project directory `NewsCards/gradle.properties`
